# Optional Original UI

## Acceptance baseline

Requested on 2026-09-12: keep the existing rewrite interface available and add
an optional interface identical to the Original Testcenter. This is a separate
acceptance axis from functional parity; the historical 94% estimate in
PARITY.md does not measure it.

Reference: `iqb-berlin/testcenter` commit
`aa627e19636bc1826854d77a4a126b2ef0b038b5`, fetched on 2026-09-12.
Compare source files from that revision, not the older local checkout.

## Required behavior

- Explicit, reversible interface selection. The existing rewrite interface
  remains the default until the Original interface passes acceptance.
- Both interfaces use the same authorized application services and persisted
  data. Switching must not reset answers, create a test run, change permissions,
  or bypass a participant navigation restriction.
- Preserve the independent Primar, Sekundar and Erwachsene presentation themes,
  authored texts, branding and participant-specific configuration.
- Do not equate a color/font override with an identical interface. Reproduce
  page structure, spacing, typography, controls, dialogs and interaction states.
- Keep rewrite-only tenant and diagnostic tools accessible without inserting
  them into the Original participant workflow.

## Acceptance matrix

Implementation in progress: the home page now offers a browser-local interface
choice. `?ui=original` and `?ui=rewrite` also select it for a direct entry. The
choice survives navigation/reload and leaves unrelated URL parameters intact.
The Original option is explicitly labelled a development preview. The initial
participant header adaptation is not a completed visual-parity claim; login,
page composition, typography, controls and all matrix comparisons remain open.

The Original participant login now has the name-first passwordless probe,
password fallback, password visibility control, back navigation and credential
error reset. It uses the existing participant sign-in, proof-of-work and
assigned-booklet/session logic, not a second authentication implementation.
Local Chromium checks exercised real passwordless and password-protected
demo-workspace accounts; mocked errors cover the view transitions without
consuming real login attempts. The main smoke also checks that Original and
Rewrite sign-in restore the same session/run. That new full smoke gate still
requires a completed run. Nunito Sans files are copied from the pinned Original
and shipped with their OFL; adapted Original layout code retains its MIT notice.
Material controls, focus fidelity and full screenshot comparisons remain open.

All rows are currently open. Close a row only with matching reference states
and browser evidence at equal viewport, theme, text and fixture settings.

| Surface | Required comparisons |
| --- | --- |
| Shell and login | Header/logo/footer, welcome panel, name/password steps, errors, admin entry |
| Participant starter | Booklet selection, start/resume/locked/completed states, review download |
| Participant player | Toolbar, unit navigation, code entry, timer, pause, leave confirmation, loading/errors |
| Workspace | Directory, files, import diagnostics, selection and batch actions |
| Results and monitor | Groups, run controls, response/review exports, attachments |
| System check | Selection, questions, network test, report submission and report administration |
| System administration | Admins, workspaces, settings, authentication and destructive-action dialogs |
| Cross-cutting | Keyboard/focus, narrow viewport, long texts, all three themes, switching persistence |

## Current upstream functional delta

The new baseline includes changes since the previous audit. Before updating
functional completion, examine sensitive-route reauthentication, login-code
case handling, API error/409 responses, report Accept-header handling and
loading transitions. CI-only changes do not create product requirements.
